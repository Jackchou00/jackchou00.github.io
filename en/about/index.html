This blog was first created on June 29, 2023, with the aim of having a place to showcase my content during the autumn recruitment period. In reality, with the half-baked experience, insight, and mindset at that time, I could not write anything decent, and that autumn recruitment, in hindsight, was unlikely to succeed. However, there were also some articles with a bit of substance, like Processing Raw Images in MATLAB, but more often, articles were hidden by me as drafts.">

For information about me and our work, please refer to my personal page and the laboratory website.\nI have many hobbies, primarily photography, cats, and coffee.\nHere This blog was first created on June 29, 2023, with the aim of having a place to showcase my content during the autumn recruitment period. In reality, with the half-baked experience, insight, and mindset at that time, I could not write anything decent, and that autumn recruitment, in hindsight, was unlikely to succeed. However, there were also some articles with a bit of substance, like Processing Raw Images in MATLAB, but more often, articles were hidden by me as drafts.\nLater, a very fortunate opportunity ended that peculiar autumn recruitment, and I no longer had the motivation or goal to update this blog, occasionally using it for some odd purposes. For example, it was used to share postcard stories with a French couple I met while staying at an Airbnb in Paris.\nThis is the story of the last time the blog was built. Some of the previous content can still be found in the Ancient Relics üåÉ.\nSince it is a static website deployed on GitHub, my other pages on GitHub would have the same domain name. Thus, if visitors access the domain directly without entering the subsequent content, they would see a chaotic, long-unupdated blog.\nTo make it more convenient to share the pages of those projects and to utilise CloudFlare‚Äôs Tunnel function, I purchased the domain jackchou00.icu, making the problem of the abandoned blog even more apparent.\nOn January 20, 2025, to satisfy my own desire to share and a bit of vanity, and to prevent this domain from pointing to an abandoned blog, the revamped JacksBlog was officially pushed. This time, its purpose is to record some aspects of research and interests, sharing images and life.\nThe webpage is generated by Hugo, using a slightly modified version of the PaperMod theme, deployed on GitHub Pages and served via Cloudflare DNS and proxy.\nFuture For some reason, I‚Äôm unable to renew the domain jackchou00.icu on Alibaba Cloud.\nTo migrate the domain, I am required to pay for one year. After migration, subsequent renewals will cost 12 USD annually. I‚Äôm still deliberating whether to commit to this 12 annual fee.\nI‚Äôve currently migrated to the domain jackchou.top, and both jackchou00.icu and zms.im are now redirecting to it.\nI‚Äôve purchased a ten-year registration for the domain jackchou.top. Where will we be in 2035?\nUpdate Log 2025.07.24: Main domain has been changed to jackchou.top. 2025.07.20: Used Gemini 2.5 Pro to translate all articles and changed English font to Lora„ÄÇ 2025.06.29: Migrated images from Alibaba Cloud OSS to Cloudflare R2. 2025.06.11: Used SaaS to accelerate domestic access and for Cloudflare Enterprise support. 2025.04.14: Added multi-language support (Experimental Support for Multiple Languages). 2025.02.17: Discovered that using tags can effectively achieve categorisation, removed the secondary category ‚ÄòColour‚Äô. 2025.02.11: Deployed GitHub Actions; now, the blog‚Äôs source files also have version management and automatic deployment. 2025.02.02: Added a button for toggling display/hide, implemented using shortcodes. 2025.01.24: Disabled MiSans to try to speed up loading; the current Chinese font is Source Han Sans from Google Fonts. 2025.01.22: Used Cloudflare R2 to store images. 2025.01.20: Updated fonts, introduced Ubuntu Sans and Ubuntu Mono using Google Fonts. The Chinese font is MiSans, loaded locally. The background colour of code blocks changed to 238. 2025.01.18: Introduced support for $\\LaTeX$ formulas, referencing PaperMod: Math Typesetting 2025.01.15: Modified the background colour of PaperMod pages.\nChanged theme in themes\\PaperMod\\assets\\css\\core\\theme-vars.css from pure white to 245.

  <div class="post-content"><h2 id="me">Me<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#me">#</a></h2>
<p>I am Jack Chou.</p>
<p>I am currently a postgraduate student in the field of colour science. For information about me and our work, please refer to <a href="http://cel.zju.edu.cn/2024/0923/c27449a2965767/page.htm">my personal page</a> and the <a href="http://cel.zju.edu.cn">laboratory website</a>.</p>
<p>I have many hobbies, primarily photography, cats, and coffee.</p>
<h2 id="here">Here<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#here">#</a></h2>
<p>This blog was first created on <a href="/posts/old/helloworld/">June 29, 2023</a>, with the aim of having a place to showcase my content during the autumn recruitment period. In reality, with the half-baked experience, insight, and mindset at that time, I could not write anything decent, and that autumn recruitment, in hindsight, was unlikely to succeed. However, there were also some articles with a bit of substance, like <a href="/posts/old/processingrawinmatlab/">Processing Raw Images in MATLAB</a>, but more often, articles were hidden by me as drafts.</p>
<p>Later, a very fortunate opportunity ended that peculiar autumn recruitment, and I no longer had the motivation or goal to update this blog, occasionally using it for some odd purposes. For example, it was used to share <a href="/posts/old/postcards01/">postcard stories</a> with a French couple I met while staying at an Airbnb in Paris.</p>
<p>This is the story of the last time the blog was built. Some of the previous content can still be found in the <a href="/posts/old/">Ancient Relics üåÉ</a>.</p>
<p>Since it is a static website deployed on GitHub, my other pages on GitHub would have the same domain name. Thus, if visitors access the domain directly without entering the subsequent content, they would see a chaotic, long-unupdated blog.</p>
<p>To make it more convenient to share the pages of those projects and to utilise CloudFlare&rsquo;s Tunnel function, I purchased the domain <a href="https://jackchou00.icu">jackchou00.icu</a>, making the problem of the abandoned blog even more apparent.</p>
<p>On January 20, 2025, to satisfy my own desire to share and a bit of vanity, and to prevent this domain from pointing to an abandoned blog, the revamped JacksBlog was officially pushed. This time, its purpose is to record some aspects of research and interests, sharing images and life.</p>
<p>The webpage is generated by Hugo, using a slightly modified version of the PaperMod theme, deployed on GitHub Pages and served via Cloudflare DNS and proxy.</p>
<h2 id="future">Future<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#future">#</a></h2>
<p>For some reason, I&rsquo;m unable to renew the domain jackchou00.icu on Alibaba Cloud.</p>
<p>To migrate the domain, I am required to pay for one year. After migration, subsequent renewals will cost 12 USD annually. I&rsquo;m still deliberating whether to commit to this 12 annual fee.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve currently migrated to the domain jackchou.top, and both jackchou00.icu and zms.im are now redirecting to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased a ten-year registration for the domain jackchou.top. Where will we be in 2035?</p>
<h2 id="update-log">Update Log<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#update-log">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>2025.07.24: Main domain has been changed to jackchou.top.</li>
<li>2025.07.20: Used Gemini 2.5 Pro to translate all articles and changed English font to Lora„ÄÇ</li>
<li>2025.06.29: Migrated images from Alibaba Cloud OSS to Cloudflare R2.</li>
<li>2025.06.11: Used SaaS to accelerate domestic access and for Cloudflare Enterprise support.</li>
<li>2025.04.14: Added multi-language support (Experimental Support for Multiple Languages).</li>
<li>2025.02.17: Discovered that using tags can effectively achieve categorisation, removed the secondary category &lsquo;Colour&rsquo;.</li>
<li>2025.02.11: Deployed GitHub Actions; now, the blog&rsquo;s source files also have version management and automatic deployment.</li>
<li>2025.02.02: Added a button for toggling display/hide, implemented using shortcodes.</li>
<li>2025.01.24: Disabled MiSans to try to speed up loading; the current Chinese font is Source Han Sans from Google Fonts.</li>
<li>2025.01.22: Used Cloudflare R2 to store images.</li>
<li>2025.01.20: Updated fonts, introduced Ubuntu Sans and Ubuntu Mono using Google Fonts. The Chinese font is MiSans, loaded locally. The background colour of code blocks changed to <code>238</code>.</li>
<li>2025.01.18: Introduced support for $\LaTeX$ formulas, referencing <a href="https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/math-typesetting/">PaperMod: Math Typesetting</a></li>
<li>2025.01.15: Modified the background colour of PaperMod pages.<br>
Changed <code>theme</code> in <code>themes\PaperMod\assets\css\core\theme-vars.css</code> from pure white to <code>245</code>.</li>
