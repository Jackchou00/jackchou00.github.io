Built with Hugo.","keywords":["Jacksblog","Jackchou","Jack Chou","Miaosen Zhou"],"articleBody":"Me I am Jack Chou.\nI am currently a postgraduate student in the field of colour science. For information about me and our work, please refer to my personal page and the laboratory website. For any questions or discussions about colour science, imaging, and display, feel free to contact me through any means. My email is jackchou00@zju.edu.cn.\nSome small tools and projects related to colour science can be found on GitHub, such as parsing and processing high dynamic range image formats, models for display or camera characterisation, etc.\nI am ashamed to say that I have not yet written any papers that I personally consider worth reading; if I do in the future, I will post them here as well.\nI have many hobbies, primarily photography, cats, and coffee, and tinkering with small gadgets.\nHere This blog was first created on June 29, 2023, with the aim of having a place to showcase my content during the autumn recruitment period. In reality, with the half-baked experience, insight, and mindset at that time, I could not write anything decent, and that autumn recruitment, in hindsight, was unlikely to succeed. However, there were also some articles with a bit of substance, like Processing Raw Images in MATLAB, but more often, articles were hidden by me as drafts.\nLater, a very fortunate opportunity ended that peculiar autumn recruitment, and I no longer had the motivation or goal to update this blog, occasionally using it for some odd purposes. For example, it was used to share postcard stories with a French couple I met while staying at an Airbnb in Paris.\nThis is the story of the last time the blog was built. Some of the previous content can still be found in the Ancient Relics 🌃.\nSince it is a static website deployed on GitHub, my other pages on GitHub would have the same domain name. Thus, if visitors access the domain directly without entering the subsequent content, they would see a chaotic, long-unupdated blog.\nTo make it more convenient to share the pages of those projects and to utilise CloudFlare’s Tunnel function, I purchased the domain jackchou00.icu, making the problem of the abandoned blog even more apparent.\nOn January 20, 2025, to satisfy my own desire to share and vanity, and to prevent this domain from pointing to an abandoned blog, the revamped JacksBlog was officially pushed. This time, its purpose is to record some aspects of research and interests, sharing images and life.\nThe webpage is generated by Hugo, using a slightly modified version of the PaperMod theme, deployed on GitHub Pages and served via Cloudflare DNS and proxy.\nFuture After the jackchou00.icu domain expires, I chose to switch to jackchou.top as the main domain. This domain was purchased for ten years, until 2035. Where will we be then?\nAdditionally, there are some other domains, such as zms.im and miaosenzhou.com, which currently redirect here.\nUpdate Log 2025.12.21: Disabled custom fonts and visitor statistics to try to speed up loading. 2025.12.09: Use SaaS and selected domains to accelerate access for china mainland users. 2025.11.22: Add Keywords and Description for all pages. 2025.10.16: Switched the code font to Google Sans Code and slightly increased the font weight. 2025.09.05: Using serif and sans-serif fonts at the same time looked too strange, switched to a font called Sen. 2025.08.12: Attempted to optimise the layout for wide-screen devices, expanding the content width in two tiers based on the total width. The changes are located in themes/PaperMod/assets/css/core/zmedia.css. 2025.08.03: Added a badge to the footer for a rough visitor count. 2025.07.24: Main domain has been changed to jackchou.top. 2025.07.20: Used Gemini 2.5 Pro to translate all articles and changed English font to Lora。 2025.06.29: Migrated images from Alibaba Cloud OSS to Cloudflare R2. 2025.06.11: Used SaaS to accelerate domestic access and for Cloudflare Enterprise support. 2025.04.14: Added multi-language support (Experimental Support for Multiple Languages). 2025.02.17: Discovered that using tags can effectively achieve categorisation, removed the secondary category ‘Colour’. 2025.02.11: Deployed GitHub Actions; now, the blog’s source files also have version management and automatic deployment. 2025.02.02: Added a button for toggling display/hide, implemented using shortcodes. 2025.01.24: Disabled MiSans to try to speed up loading; the current Chinese font is Source Han Sans from Google Fonts. 2025.01.22: Used Cloudflare R2 to store images. 2025.01.20: Updated fonts, introduced Ubuntu Sans and Ubuntu Mono using Google Fonts. The Chinese font is MiSans, loaded locally. The background colour of code blocks changed to 238. 2025.01.18: Introduced support for $\\LaTeX$ formulas, referencing PaperMod: Math Typesetting 2025.01.15: Modified the background colour of PaperMod pages.\nChanged theme in themes\\PaperMod\\assets\\css\\core\\theme-vars.css from pure white to 245.
