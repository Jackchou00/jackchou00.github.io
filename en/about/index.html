Where will we be in 2035?\nUpdate Log 2025.10.16: Switched the code font to Google Sans Code and slightly increased the font weight. 2025.09.05: Using serif and sans-serif fonts at the same time looked too strange, switched to a font called Sen. 2025.08.12: Attempted to optimise the layout for wide-screen devices, expanding the content width in two tiers based on the total width. The changes are located in themes/PaperMod/assets/css/core/zmedia.css. 2025.08.03: Added a badge to the footer for a rough visitor count. 2025.07.24: Main domain has been changed to jackchou.top. 2025.07.20: Used Gemini 2.5 Pro to translate all articles and changed English font to Lora„ÄÇ 2025.06.29: Migrated images from Alibaba Cloud OSS to Cloudflare R2. 2025.06.11: Used SaaS to accelerate domestic access and for Cloudflare Enterprise support. 2025.04.14: Added multi-language support (Experimental Support for Multiple Languages). 2025.02.17: Discovered that using tags can effectively achieve categorisation, removed the secondary category ‚ÄòColour‚Äô. 2025.02.11: Deployed GitHub Actions; now, the blog‚Äôs source files also have version management and automatic deployment. 2025.02.02: Added a button for toggling display/hide, implemented using shortcodes. 2025.01.24: Disabled MiSans to try to speed up loading; the current Chinese font is Source Han Sans from Google Fonts. 2025.01.22: Used Cloudflare R2 to store images. 2025.01.20: Updated fonts, introduced Ubuntu Sans and Ubuntu Mono using Google Fonts. The Chinese font is MiSans, loaded locally. The background colour of code blocks changed to 238. 2025.01.18: Introduced support for $\\LaTeX$ formulas, referencing PaperMod: Math Typesetting 2025.01.15: Modified the background colour of PaperMod pages.\nChanged theme in themes\\PaperMod\\assets\\css\\core\\theme-vars.css from pure white to 245.
